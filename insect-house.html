                  <p>An insect hotel, also known as a bug hotel or insect house, is a manmade structure created to provide shelter for insects. They can come in a variety of shapes and sizes depending on the specific purpose or specific insect it is catered to. Most consist of several different sections that provide insects with nesting facilities â€“ particularly during winter, offering shelter or refuge for many types of insects. Their purposes include hosting pollinators.
